    <div class="p1">
        <p> Planets are celestial bodies that orbit stars and do not produce their own light. In our solar system, there are eight known planets, divided into two categories. The inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are rocky and relatively small. The outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are gas giants or ice giants with thick atmospheres and many moons. Earth is the only planet known to support life, with its perfect balance of atmosphere, water, and distance from the Sun. Planets are studied to understand their compositions, climates, and possibilities of life beyond Earth. </p>

        <h1>Super Nova</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="p2">
        <p> A supernova is one of the most powerful explosions in the universe, occurring when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel. The star's core collapses, releasing a burst of energy that can briefly outshine an entire galaxy. Supernovae scatter heavy elements like iron and gold into space, enriching future generations of stars and planets. These cosmic events also play a crucial role in the formation of black holes and neutron stars. </p>

        <h1>Dark Matter</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="p2">
        <p> Dark matter is an invisible substance that does not emit or absorb light, yet it makes up about 27% of the universe. Scientists detect it through its gravitational effects on galaxies and cosmic structures. Without dark matter, galaxies would not hold together. Its true nature remains one of the biggest mysteries in astrophysics.
