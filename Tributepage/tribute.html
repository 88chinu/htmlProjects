                <h1>About Swami Vivekananda</h1>
                <p>
                    Swami Vivekananda was born on 12 January 1863 in Kolkata, India. His pre-monastic name was Narendranath Datta. He was a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna and a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. Vivekananda is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He is perhaps best known for his speech at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893, where he began his address with "Sisters and brothers of America," which received a standing ovation from the audience.
